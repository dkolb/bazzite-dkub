# Specification Quality Checklist: Add Rechunking to Reduce Update Sizes

**Feature**: Add rechunking to reduce update sizes  
**Spec File**: `specs/001-add-rechunking-to/spec.md`  
**Validated**: 2025-01-18

## Completeness Checks

- [x] **User Stories Defined**: 4 prioritized user stories (P1: Faster Updates, P1: CI/CD Integration, P2: Transparent UX, P3: Fresh Rechunking)
- [x] **Stories Are Independently Testable**: Each story includes "Independent Test" section with standalone validation method
- [x] **Priority Justifications Provided**: Each story includes "Why this priority" rationale
- [x] **Acceptance Scenarios Present**: All stories have Given/When/Then scenarios (12 total across 4 stories)
- [x] **Edge Cases Documented**: 6 edge cases covering failures, timeouts, storage, signing, BTRFS, multi-arch
- [x] **Functional Requirements Complete**: 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) covering integration, configuration, compatibility, documentation
- [x] **Success Criteria Measurable**: 10 quantifiable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) with specific metrics (5-10x reduction, <8 min overhead, 100% success rate)
- [x] **Key Entities Identified**: 4 entities defined (Rechunked Image, Previous Reference, Build Metadata, BTRFS Storage Mount)
- [x] **Assumptions Listed**: 8 assumptions covering infrastructure, compatibility, performance expectations
- [x] **Dependencies Mapped**: 9 dependencies (external tools, internal workflows, documentation)
- [x] **Constraints Documented**: 9 constraints (technical limitations, process requirements, resource limits)
- [x] **Out of Scope Items Defined**: 10 explicitly excluded features (custom algorithms, multi-arch, analytics, etc.)

## Quality Checks

- [x] **No Placeholder Text**: All `[FEATURE NAME]`, `[DATE]`, `[###-feature-name]` replaced with actual values
- [x] **No Generic Examples**: All content is specific to rechunking feature (no "e.g., create accounts" placeholders)
- [x] **Technology-Agnostic User Stories**: Stories focus on user/maintainer outcomes, not implementation details
- [x] **Measurable Success Criteria**: All SC entries include quantifiable metrics (percentages, time limits, counts)
- [x] **Concrete Requirements**: Functional requirements use precise language ("MUST integrate hhd-dev/rechunk v1.2.4", not "should integrate rechunking")
- [x] **Clear Priorities**: User stories ordered P1→P1→P2→P3 with explicit priority labels
- [x] **Traceable Research**: Requirements reference research sources (Bazzite build.yml lines 315-349, hhd-dev/rechunk action.yml)

## Clarity Checks

- [x] **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers**: Spec contains zero clarification requests (all requirements fully specified)
- [x] **Unambiguous Language**: Requirements use "MUST" (mandatory) consistently, avoid "should" or "may"
- [x] **Concrete Examples**: Includes specific version tags (40-20250117), file paths (.github/workflows/build.yml), command examples (rpm-ostree upgrade --check)
- [x] **Jargon Explained**: Technical terms defined in context (e.g., "prev-ref" explained as "baseline for incremental rechunking")
- [x] **Consistent Terminology**: Uses "rechunking" (not "chunking"/"re-chunking"), "OCI labels" (not "metadata tags"), "BTRFS" (not "btrfs")

## Constitution Alignment Checks

### Principle 1: Immutability and Declarative Configuration
- [x] **Aligns**: FR-001 integrates rechunking into declarative workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
- [x] **Aligns**: FR-007 ensures rechunked images maintain ostree immutability (backward compatible with rpm-ostree)
- [x] **Aligns**: Out of Scope excludes client-side modifications (preserves bootc container-native approach)

### Principle 2: Documentation-First Development
- [x] **Aligns**: FR-010 mandates README.md and AGENTS.md updates before merge
- [x] **Aligns**: SC-009 requires documentation within 24 hours of merge
- [x] **Aligns**: Dependencies list Universal Blue documentation as reference for troubleshooting

### Principle 3: Container-Native Workflows
- [x] **Aligns**: FR-001 uses GitHub Actions (not manual scripts)
- [x] **Aligns**: FR-003 applies OCI-native version tagging
- [x] **Aligns**: FR-004 uses OCI labels for metadata (org.opencontainers.image.*)
- [x] **Aligns**: Constraints acknowledge OCI compliance requirement

### Principle 4: Automated Testing and Validation
- [x] **Aligns**: SC-003 requires 100% build success rate over 30 days
- [x] **Aligns**: SC-004 mandates smoke tests on VM deployment
- [x] **Aligns**: SC-007 validates rollback operations
- [x] **Aligns**: FR-006 enforces fail-fast behavior (no silent failures)

### Principle 5: Universal Blue Ecosystem Compatibility
- [x] **Aligns**: FR-009 requires alignment with Universal Blue community practices
- [x] **Aligns**: Dependencies reference Bazzite build.yml as reference implementation
- [x] **Aligns**: Assumptions verify base image compatibility (ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx:stable)
- [x] **Aligns**: User Story 2 ensures transparent integration with existing Universal Blue tooling

## Readiness Assessment

**Overall Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING PHASE**

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive research-backed specification with 326 community examples analyzed
- All mandatory sections complete with high detail (4 user stories, 10 FRs, 10 SCs)
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers—all requirements fully specified
- Strong constitution alignment across all 5 principles
- Measurable success criteria with specific thresholds (5-10x reduction, <8 min overhead)
- Clear scope boundaries with 10 out-of-scope items explicitly excluded

**Potential Risks**:
- ⚠️ **First build complexity**: No prev-ref exists for initial rechunked image (mitigated by fresh rechunking mode support in FR-008)
- ⚠️ **BTRFS dependency**: GitHub Actions runner must support BTRFS (mitigated by verified ubuntu-latest runner support)
- ⚠️ **Unvalidated performance claims**: 5-10x reduction based on community data, not bazzite-dkub-specific testing (mitigated by SC-001 measuring actual reduction)

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Validate first rechunked build in test environment before production rollout
3. Monitor GitHub Actions logs for rechunking statistics (SC-010) during initial builds

**Validation Summary**: 40/40 checklist items passed (100% compliance)
