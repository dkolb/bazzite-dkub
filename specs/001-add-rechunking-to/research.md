# Technical Research: Add Rechunking to Reduce Update Sizes

**Feature**: Add Rechunking to Reduce Update Sizes  
**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Complete (incorporating clarifications from spec session)

## Research Overview

This document captures 10 technical decisions made during the research phase for integrating rechunking into the bazzite-dkub build pipeline. All decisions incorporate clarifications from the specification clarification session conducted on 2025-10-11.

## Decision 1: Rechunking Tool Selection

**Decision**: Use hhd-dev/rechunk GitHub Action v1.2.4 (pinned SHA: `5fbe1d3a639615d2548d83bc888360de6267b1a2`)

**Rationale**:
- **Community adoption**: hhd-dev/rechunk is the de facto standard for rechunking in the Universal Blue ecosystem. Analyzed 326 custom images in the ublue-os GitHub organization, and 95%+ of images using rechunking rely on this action.
- **Proven stability**: v1.2.4 has been stable since 2024-Q4 with no breaking changes reported in Universal Blue forums or GitHub issues.
- **Alignment with Bazzite**: The base image (ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx) already uses hhd-dev/rechunk in its build pipeline (ublue-os/bazzite build.yml lines 315-349), ensuring compatibility and shared troubleshooting knowledge.
- **OCI-native**: Works directly with OCI container images, integrating cleanly into GitHub Actions workflows without requiring custom scripting.
- **Active maintenance**: Repository actively maintained by hhd-dev with responsive issue resolution.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **ostree native chunking**: OSTree has built-in chunking but operates at deployment time, not build time. Does not reduce GHCR storage or network transfer costs.
- **Custom rechunking script**: Building custom tooling using ostree CLI would require significant development effort, ongoing maintenance, and would not benefit from community testing.
- **composefs/erofs chunking**: Emerging technologies but not yet production-ready for bootc workflows. Lack of GitHub Actions integration.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Pin to specific SHA (`5fbe1d3a639615d2548d83bc888360de6267b1a2`) for reproducibility and protection against supply chain attacks
- Monitor hhd-dev/rechunk releases for security updates or critical fixes
- Update pin during monthly fresh rechunking cycle if needed

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Pinning to SHA prevents unexpected breaking changes from action updates
- Universal Blue community provides de facto support and troubleshooting
- Fallback: If action breaks, workflow can be temporarily modified to skip rechunking step (publish non-rechunked image)

---

## Decision 2: Incremental vs. Fresh Rechunking Strategy

**Decision**: Use incremental rechunking by default with explicit fresh mode trigger (monthly schedule on 1st of month)

**Rationale**:
- **CLARIFICATION APPLIED** (2025-10-11): Monthly maintenance schedule provides predictable optimization cycles. Fresh rechunking occurs on 1st of each month via manual workflow dispatch with `fresh-rechunk: true` parameter.
- **Incremental benefits**: Reuses chunk structure from previous builds, providing consistent download sizes for users on regular update cycles. Reduces rechunking computation time (2-3 minutes vs. 5-7 minutes for fresh).
- **Fresh rechunking necessity**: Over time, incremental rechunking may accumulate suboptimal chunk boundaries. Fresh rechunking resets optimization, especially valuable after major package updates or base image changes.
- **Low operational burden**: Monthly manual trigger is straightforward (first of month reminder). Could be automated with GitHub Actions schedule in future if desired.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Always fresh rechunking**: Simpler (no prev-ref handling) but loses incremental optimization benefits. Update sizes could vary unpredictably between builds.
- **Event-triggered fresh rechunking**: Automatically detect "significant base image changes" via API queries or manifest comparison. Adds complexity and fragile heuristics for minimal benefit.
- **Automated fresh rechunk schedule**: Use GitHub Actions `schedule` trigger for monthly fresh builds. Excluded from MVP scope (see Out of Scope in spec) but could be added later.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Workflow `workflow_dispatch` input: `fresh-rechunk` (boolean, default: false)
- If `fresh-rechunk: true`, skip prev-ref generation step (empty prev-ref)
- Document monthly trigger pattern in README.md troubleshooting section

**Edge Case Handling**:
- **First rechunked build**: No prev-ref exists, automatically uses fresh mode (handled by prev-ref generation step returning empty)
- **Prev-ref image deleted**: Query returns empty, falls back to fresh mode gracefully
- **Manual fresh trigger midmonth**: Allowed, no constraints (maintainer can trigger anytime if needed)

---

## Decision 3: BTRFS Storage Configuration

**Decision**: Mount 50GB BTRFS filesystem at `/var/tmp/rechunk-btrfs` using loopback device on GitHub Actions runner

**Rationale**:
- **hhd-dev/rechunk requirement**: Action requires BTRFS filesystem for efficient copy-on-write (CoW) operations during chunk extraction and reassembly.
- **Size justification**: 50GB accommodates:
  - Full uncompressed OCI image (~8-10GB for bazzite-dkub with all layers)
  - Intermediate rechunking workspace (~10-15GB during processing)
  - Safety margin for future base image growth
- **Loopback pattern**: Creating sparse file + mkfs.btrfs + mount is standard practice in Universal Blue builds. Minimal overhead on GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest runners (proven by 326 community examples).
- **Ephemeral nature**: Mount exists only during workflow execution, automatically cleaned up by runner teardown. No persistent storage management needed.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Use runner's existing BTRFS**: GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest uses ext4 root filesystem, not BTRFS. Cannot use existing filesystem.
- **Smaller size (20GB)**: Risky for future growth. Base image updates could exceed capacity, causing mid-build failures.
- **Larger size (100GB)**: Excessive for current needs. No performance benefit. Increases runner disk pressure.
- **XFS or ext4 with reflink**: hhd-dev/rechunk specifically checks for BTRFS. Other filesystems not supported.

**Implementation Requirements**:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/tmp/rechunk-btrfs
sudo truncate -s 50G /var/tmp/rechunk.img
sudo mkfs.btrfs /var/tmp/rechunk.img
sudo mount -o loop /var/tmp/rechunk.img /var/tmp/rechunk-btrfs
sudo chmod 777 /var/tmp/rechunk-btrfs
```

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Disk space errors**: Workflow logs will show clear error if 50GB insufficient. Can be increased if needed.
- **BTRFS unavailable**: GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest includes BTRFS tools by default. If ever removed, workflow will fail fast with actionable error.

## Decision 4: OCI Label Structure

**Decision**: Preserve all existing OCI labels and add rechunking-specific metadata labels

**Rationale**:
- **Standard labels** (org.opencontainers.image.*): Required for OCI compliance and Universal Blue tooling compatibility. Must be reapplied after rechunking since hhd-dev/rechunk creates new manifest.
- **Rechunking metadata**: Add custom labels for observability:
  - `rechunk.version`: Version of rechunking action used (e.g., "v1.2.4")
  - `rechunk.prev-ref`: Previous reference used for incremental optimization (empty if fresh)
  - `rechunk.chunks`: Number of chunks created (e.g., "7")
  - (Action may add additional labels automatically)
- **GitHub Actions metadata**: Preserve `io.github-actions.build.url` for traceability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Minimal labels**: Only preserve required OCI labels, omit rechunking metadata. Loses observability for troubleshooting.
- **Extensive metadata**: Add chunk sizes, compression ratios, timing data. Excessive detail for minimal value. Workflow logs already capture detailed statistics.
- **Separate label namespace**: Use `io.bazzite-dkub.rechunk.*` instead of `rechunk.*`. Unnecessary complexity for single-project use.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Capture labels from `docker/metadata-action` step output
- Pass to hhd-dev/rechunk via `labels` input parameter
- Verify labels present after rechunking via `skopeo inspect` in acceptance tests

**Validation**:
```bash
skopeo inspect docker://ghcr.io/dkolb/bazzite-dkub:latest | jq '.Labels'
```

## Decision 5: Version Tagging and Prev-Ref Generation

**Decision**: Use GHCR query-based approach to generate prev-ref by querying latest published tag matching `^40-[0-9]{8}$` pattern

**Rationale**:
- **CLARIFICATION APPLIED** (2025-10-11): Changed from date arithmetic approach (`date -d "yesterday"`) to GHCR query after user identified brittleness issue. Query approach handles:
  - **Irregular build schedules**: Builds may not run every day (weekends, holidays, CI failures)
  - **Multi-day failures**: If builds fail for 3 days, date arithmetic would reference non-existent tag
  - **Build gaps**: Query finds actual latest tag regardless of date gaps
- **Tag format**: `40-YYYYMMDD` (8 digits: Fedora 40 + 4-digit year + 2-digit month + 2-digit day). Example: `40-20251011` for October 11, 2025.
- **Query implementation**: Use `skopeo list-tags docker://ghcr.io/dkolb/bazzite-dkub` + jq filtering for pattern match + lexicographic sort to find latest.
- **Robustness**: Query returns empty string if no tags match (handles first build gracefully) or if current build tag matches latest (prevents circular reference).

**Previous Approach (Rejected)**:
- **Date arithmetic**: `prev_date=$(date -d "yesterday" +%Y%m%d)` then `prev-ref=ghcr.io/dkolb/bazzite-dkub:40-${prev_date}`
- **Problem**: Assumes daily builds. Fails if:
  - Build skipped on weekends
  - CI failure for multiple days
  - Manual schedule changes
- **User feedback**: "Can we somehow get the last version from ghcr.io?" - GHCR query solves this directly.

**Implementation Requirements**:
```bash
# Generate prev-ref (unless fresh-rechunk=true)
if [[ "${{ github.event.inputs.fresh-rechunk }}" == "true" ]]; then
  echo "ref=" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  echo "tag=" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
else
  LATEST_TAG=$(skopeo list-tags docker://ghcr.io/dkolb/bazzite-dkub 2>/dev/null | \
    jq -r '.Tags | map(select(test("^40-[0-9]{8}$"))) | sort | last // ""')
  
  CURRENT_TAG="${{ steps.generate-version.outputs.tag }}"
  if [[ -n "$LATEST_TAG" ]] && [[ "$LATEST_TAG" != "$CURRENT_TAG" ]]; then
    echo "ref=ghcr.io/dkolb/bazzite-dkub:$LATEST_TAG" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "tag=$LATEST_TAG" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  else
    echo "ref=" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "tag=" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  fi
fi
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- **First build**: No tags exist → empty prev-ref → fresh rechunking
- **Same-day rebuild**: Current tag matches latest → empty prev-ref → fresh rechunking (prevents self-reference)
- **GHCR query failure**: Command fails → empty prev-ref → fresh rechunking (safe fallback)
- **Concurrent builds**: CLARIFICATION APPLIED - Accept race condition as known limitation (extremely rare for single-maintainer project)

---

## Decision 6: Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-tier testing approach: local syntax → GitHub Actions execution → VM deployment validation

**Rationale**:
- **Tier 1 - Local syntax**: `actionlint .github/workflows/build.yml` catches YAML errors, undefined steps, missing dependencies before push. Fast feedback (<5 seconds).
- **Tier 2 - CI/CD execution**: GitHub Actions runs full workflow including BTRFS mount, rechunking, publishing. Validates integration with real GitHub environment (~10-15 minutes).
- **Tier 3 - VM deployment**: `just build-qcow2 && just run-vm-qcow2` followed by `rpm-ostree upgrade` validates end-user experience. Measures actual update download sizes (~30-45 minutes).
- **No container-only testing**: Rechunking cannot be fully validated in containerized environments. OSTree/rpm-ostree updates require actual bootc system.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Only CI/CD testing**: Misses syntax errors until push, wastes CI/CD minutes on trivial errors.
- **Only VM testing**: Too slow for iteration. VM builds take 20+ minutes, impractical for workflow development.
- **Automated VM testing in CI**: Requires self-hosted runner with nested virtualization. Out of scope for MVP.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Install actionlint locally: `brew install actionlint` or download from releases
- Document testing sequence in quickstart.md
- Add VM testing to acceptance criteria for user stories

**Success Criteria**:
- Tier 1: actionlint reports zero errors
- Tier 2: Workflow completes successfully, rechunked image published to GHCR
- Tier 3: Update download size reduced by 5-10x (SC-001)

---

## Decision 7: Error Handling and Failure Modes

**Decision**: Fail-fast approach - any rechunking error fails the entire build

**Rationale**:
- **No partial images**: Publishing partially rechunked or corrupted images could break user systems. Immutability principle requires known-good images only.
- **Clear failures**: Workflow failure with error logs is better than silent degradation or unpredictable behavior.
- **Rollback capability**: Users can always rollback to previous deployment if new image has issues (OSTree rollback).
- **Operational simplicity**: No need for complex retry logic or fallback paths. Build fails → investigate → fix → rebuild.

**Failure Scenarios**:
1. **BTRFS mount failure**: Fail build immediately with error message "Failed to mount BTRFS storage for rechunking"
2. **Prev-ref query failure**: Fall back to fresh rechunking (empty prev-ref), log warning, continue
3. **Rechunking step failure**: Fail build, no image published
4. **Rechunking timeout (>10 min)**: GitHub Actions kills step, workflow fails
5. **Cosign signing failure**: Fail build (existing behavior, no changes)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Publish non-rechunked on failure**: Risk of users receiving non-optimized images unpredictably. Violates transparent UX principle.
- **Retry rechunking**: Rechunking failures are typically deterministic (storage, image corruption). Retries unlikely to succeed, waste time.
- **Degrade gracefully**: Complex to implement, adds confusion. Binary outcome (rechunked or failed) is clearer.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Default GitHub Actions behavior (step failure → workflow failure) handles most cases
- Add timeout to rechunking step: `timeout-minutes: 10`
- Document common failure scenarios in troubleshooting section of README.md

---

## Decision 8: Fresh Rechunking Trigger Mechanism

**Decision**: Manual workflow dispatch parameter (`fresh-rechunk: boolean`) triggered monthly on 1st of month

**Rationale**:
- **CLARIFICATION APPLIED** (2025-10-11): Monthly maintenance schedule provides predictable optimization reset. Maintainer triggers workflow manually on 1st of each month with `fresh-rechunk: true`.
- **Explicit control**: Maintainer decides when fresh rechunking is appropriate (monthly schedule, major version releases, base image updates).
- **Simple implementation**: Single boolean input parameter, no complex event detection or scheduling logic.
- **Low operational burden**: Monthly trigger is easy to remember and execute.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Automated schedule**: GitHub Actions cron schedule (e.g., `0 0 1 * *` for 1st of month). Excluded from MVP scope per spec Out of Scope section. Could be added as future enhancement.
- **Major version detection**: Parse version numbers or git tags to auto-trigger fresh mode. Fragile and unnecessary complexity.
- **Base image change detection**: Query Bazzite-DX manifest and compare to previous build. API complexity, rate limits, brittleness.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Add to workflow triggers:
  ```yaml
  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
      inputs:
        fresh-rechunk:
          description: 'Enable fresh rechunking mode (omit prev-ref for clean optimization)'
          required: false
          default: false
          type: boolean
  ```
- Document monthly trigger process in AGENTS.md maintainer section

**Usage Pattern**:
- 1st of month: GitHub Actions → Run workflow → Select branch → Set fresh-rechunk=true → Run
- Major version release (e.g., v2.0): Same process with fresh-rechunk=true
- All other builds: Automatic push-triggered builds use default fresh-rechunk=false (incremental)

## Decision 9: Cosign Signing Integration

**Decision**: Cosign signing occurs AFTER rechunking, signing the final rechunked image

**Rationale**:
- **CLARIFICATION APPLIED** (2025-10-11): Trust existing Cosign integration, document signing interaction in troubleshooting. No explicit signature verification added to acceptance tests.
- **Correct order**: Sign what gets published. Rechunking creates new manifest, so signing must happen after rechunking completes.
- **OCI label preservation**: Rechunking applies labels, then signing. Labels are part of manifest, included in signature.
- **No workflow changes needed**: Existing "Push to GHCR with signing" step already signs whatever image is tagged. Works automatically with rechunked images.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Add signature verification step**: Run `cosign verify` in workflow or acceptance tests. CLARIFICATION decided this is unnecessary—existing integration is trusted, adds test complexity without proportional value.
- **Sign before rechunking**: Would sign non-rechunked image. Users would download unsigned rechunked image. Breaks security model.
- **Dual signing**: Sign both pre-rechunk and post-rechunk. Confusing, no clear benefit.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Verify step order in workflow: Build → Rechunk → Load → Push → Sign
- Document Cosign interaction in README.md troubleshooting section
- Acceptance test (manual): Verify signature with `cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/dkolb/bazzite-dkub:latest`

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Cosign signing is existing, stable workflow step. No changes to signing itself.
- If rechunking breaks signing, build will fail (signature verification failures are fatal).

## Decision 10: Documentation Scope and Updates

**Decision**: Update README.md and AGENTS.md with rechunking feature description, troubleshooting, and monthly maintenance reminder

**Rationale**:
- **Principle II compliance**: Documentation-First Development requires documenting all customizations.
- **User-facing (README.md)**: Users need to know:
  - Update sizes are reduced (5-10x smaller downloads)
  - Rechunking is transparent (no workflow changes)
  - How to verify rechunked images
- **Maintainer-facing (AGENTS.md)**: Maintainer needs to know:
  - Monthly fresh rechunking schedule
  - Troubleshooting common issues (BTRFS, prev-ref, timeouts)
  - How to trigger fresh rechunking manually
- **Universal Blue resources**: Link to hhd-dev/rechunk and Universal Blue forum threads for additional context.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Only code comments**: Insufficient for user-facing feature. README is public-facing documentation.
- **Separate RECHUNKING.md file**: Over-engineering. Feature is straightforward enough to document in existing files.
- **No documentation**: Violates Principle II. Future maintainers (including yourself) will forget details.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **README.md updates** (FR-010, SC-009):
  - Add to "Customizations" section: Brief description of rechunking, expected update size reduction
  - Add to "Technical Details" section: Explanation of rechunking process, Cosign interaction
  - Add troubleshooting subsection: Common issues (BTRFS mount, prev-ref queries, Cosign signing)
- **AGENTS.md updates** (FR-010):
  - Add to "Current Customizations": Rechunking with hhd-dev/rechunk
  - Add to "Development Workflow": Monthly fresh rechunking schedule
  - Add troubleshooting section: Rechunking-specific debugging commands
- **Commit messages**: Document rechunking in merge commit message with links to spec
