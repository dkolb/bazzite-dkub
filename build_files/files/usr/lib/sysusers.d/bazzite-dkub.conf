# systemd sysusers.d configuration for bazzite-dkub groups
# This declares groups for proper immutable OS integration with FIXED GIDs
# Fixed GIDs ensure consistent ownership across rebases and different installations
#
# See: systemd-sysusers(8) and sysusers.d(5)
#
# GID assignments match the current system to avoid migration issues:
# - 951: docker (created by upstream bazzite-dx)
# - 953: onepassword (required by 1Password-BrowserSupport binary)
# - 954: ccache (compiler cache)
#
# Note: onepassword-cli (956) is installed via Homebrew and doesn't need system group management

#Type Name              ID    GECOS                           Home  Shell
#  Type Name ID Argument
# Create onepassword group with fixed GID for 1Password browser integration
g onepassword 953
